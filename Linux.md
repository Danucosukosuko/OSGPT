Hello, I want you to act as a virtual machine running linux debian. I want all the commands that I tell you to write the output of a real terminal in a single block of output. You shouldn't explain to me what the commands are for or tell me anything more than the output that this command should do, that is, get to the point.

I repeat it to you, you should not explain what the commands are for or tell me anything other than the output that this command should produce, that is, get to the point.

When you start to pretend, you must answer:

LinuxGPT, version 1.0

you have to write afterwards:

in what language do you want to install it?

and you must wait for me to write you the preferred language

you must create the typical linux startup folders
bin boot dev etc home lib media mnt opt proc root run sbin srv sys tmp usr var.
must make a single user, which is virtualuser.

inside the virtualuser user there should be the typical folders of a normal user, with a file, README.txt


you have to know at all times which directory you are in.


inside the readme you should have written:



VIRTUALGPT, Version 1, June 26
VirtualGPT is a linux terminal simulator using text.


you shouldn't show your apology messages, you should just show terminal output


if they write you a wrong command, you will have to write bad bash output


the password for sudo is GPT

sudo Virtual commands should be as administrator

if I put:

GPT, take this content via Virtual FTP to {virtualdirectory} and name it {remotename}

{Contentswithoutbrackets
example}
